# audioDeepLearning

### Purpose
A repo that walks through the basics of deep learning by 
implementing the internals from scratch. Moreover, 
there will be an emphasis on audio data in the later folders. This 
will serve as an introduction to my journey into Music Information Retrieval and
Deep Learning for Audio.

### Source
I'm heavily referencing and following the brilliant work of [Valerio Velardo](https://valeriovelardo.com). In particular, 
his playlist: [Deep Learning (for Audio) with Python](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-wATfeyAMNrtbkCNsLcpoAyBBRJZVlnf)

### Folders
#### 3-neurons
An implementation of a single neuron.

#### 6-mlp
Implement a fully connected feed forward NN with training via back propagation + 
gradient descent.
